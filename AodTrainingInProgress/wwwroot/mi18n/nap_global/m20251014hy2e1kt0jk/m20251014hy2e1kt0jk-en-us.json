    "gal-line-1bdbe6da-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "This must've been a car Nangong booked in secret! She clearly promised me she wouldn't use her own money to support the Angels of Delusion anymore!",
    "gal-line-1bdbe6db-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "It's just that the Outer Ring is too far away~ If we took a bus to the studio, everyone would probably be worn out before we even got there...",
    "gal-line-1bdbe6dc-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Alright, alright~ Aria, take Sunna to cool down a bit. We still have training today.",

    "gal-line-1bdbe6e3-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah! It's that feeling of not being trusted and being left out. Actually, people around me often say I lack a sense of money...",
    "gal-line-1bdbe6e4-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hahaha, that's true! She almost became the boss of the Outer Ring biker crew... and she even signed up video-store memberships for everyone on the street!",

    "gal-line-1bdbe6e6-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Because Dennies can't solve everything, and that's not the reason friends stay by your side.",

    "gal-line-1bdc0de8-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Eh-heh~",
    "gal-line-2b691d10-c5ef-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Our voices and dance moves are totally in sync with this...",

    "gal-line-2b691d12-c5ef-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "This way, the training content becomes visualized and the training targets become super clear~",

    "gal-line-2b694423-c5ef-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hey Sunna~ I know you're eager, but hold on a sec — have you forgotten something important?",
    "gal-line-2b694424-c5ef-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "S—Something really important... Oh! You mean that cele— mmph!",
    "gal-line-2b694425-c5ef-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah, yeah, yeah! That's the thing we promised our teacher~ The daily training check-in! Haven't done today's check-in yet!",
    "gal-line-2b694426-c5ef-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah, assistant coaches, please come over here too~",
    "gal-line-2b694427-c5ef-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ta-da! Did we startle you, assistant coaches?",
    "gal-line-2b694428-c5ef-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Aaah! Nangong, why did you shoot the party poppers at me? Now there's confetti stuck in my hair!",
    "gal-line-2b694429-c5ef-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmph~ That's what you get for almost spoiling the surprise, you silly goose!",
    "gal-line-2b69442a-c5ef-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "H—Hold on a sec. Guess we're trying to say — thank you so much for accepting our commission and agreeing to train us!",
    "gal-line-2b69442b-c5ef-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Mhm... We'll train super duper hard! A—Absolutely no slacking off!",

    "gal-line-2b69442d-c5ef-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Alright then, let's say it together — three, two, one —",

    "gal-line-412ecd84-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "No, no! It's just that... seeing how seriously Nangong is taking care of everyone...",
    "gal-line-412ecd85-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "You've got that leader vibe going.",

    "gal-line-412ecd88-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Haha, come to think of it, with two little ones to look after, I really am the \"big sis\" here~",
    "gal-line-412ecd89-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmph! Nangong, you're so childish — you're no big sis at all!",
    "gal-line-412ecd8a-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ahhhh... Stop squishing my cheeks, I can't talk properly...",
    "gal-line-412ecd8b-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Such a mischievous kid!",
    "gal-line-412ecd8c-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "N—Nangong, did I... did I enunciate that previous part right?",
    "gal-line-412ecd8d-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Wait, why are you suddenly patting my head...",
    "gal-line-412ecd8e-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Now this one's a good kid!",
    "gal-line-412ecd8f-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Good kids deserve a reward. You get to sing your favorite set of vocal exercises!",
    "gal-line-412ecd90-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "You naughty kid... You still can't get that set of moves right. You're not going home until you do it properly!",
    "gal-line-412ecd91-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Heh heh, bet you didn't see that coming. I was planning to put in extra practice anyway!",
    "gal-line-412ecd92-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Well then, you can join the Good Kids Club too!",
    "gal-line-412ecd93-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Y—Y—You! That's way too sneaky!!",

    "gal-line-4aa8d031-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Burger... Ah, yes, of course. Don't worry, Anby. Just make sure you help us get this assistant coach job done properly...",
    "gal-line-4aa8d032-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "But I feel like Anby still hasn't quite figured out what being an \"idol\" actually means...",
    "gal-line-4aa8d033-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Indeed... but it's fine. It shouldn't affect our work... probably...",
    "gal-line-4aa8d034-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hey, hold on, Wise. Aria looks like... she hasn't quite gotten into the right mindset yet?",
    "gal-line-4aa8d035-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "...",
    "gal-line-4aa8f740-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ariaaaa!",
    "gal-line-4aa8f741-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ah... the assistant coaches! Sorry, sorry. I think I lagged out for a moment...",
    "gal-line-4aa8f742-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "During the idol events, you need to stay alert at all times... Otherwise, you'll put yourself and your teammates in danger.",
    "gal-line-4aa8f743-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "You really have no idea what being an idol is about! But I suppose you're not totally wrong...",
    "gal-line-4aa8f744-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "You must be thinking about that incident with Astra. Yeah, that one was pretty dangerous, haha...",
    "gal-line-4aa8f745-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "I may not really get what you're talking about... but it's about combat, right? Th—That's something I actually know a bit about!",
    "gal-line-4aa8f746-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Combat...? Wait, Aria, aren't you an idol? Don't tell me you all have secret missions to carry out?",
    "gal-line-4aa8f747-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Nah, it's not like that... Our agency is always short on money, so we have to dive into the Hollow to make ends meet...",
    "gal-line-4aa8f748-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Over time, I've picked up a few tricks for fighting Ethereals... Nothing more than that!",
    "gal-line-4aa8f749-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "If the fans of Angels of Delusion ever learned about this, they'd probably be worried about us...",
    "gal-line-4aa8f74a-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "No, it's more than that... Maybe once they learn the truth behind what an \"idol\" really is, they'll...",
    "gal-line-4aa8f74b-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Aria, you do know what a burger is, right?",
    "gal-line-4aa8f74c-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Burger...? Y—Yeah, I know what that is!",
    "gal-line-4aa8f74d-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Whether it's mustard or ketchup hiding under that bun, it doesn't change the fact that burgers are delicious.",
    "gal-line-4aa8f74e-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Looks like... you're using burger as a metaphor!",
    "gal-line-4aa8f74f-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah. Both the surface and what's inside are parts of who you really are... That's something my closest friends taught me, and now I'm passing it on to you.",
    "gal-line-4aa8f750-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah, and Aria's desire to bring hope and happiness to everyone as an idol is something truly genuine.",
    "gal-line-4aa8f751-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "A round of applause! That's our best training assistant!",
    "gal-line-4aa8f752-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Genuine, huh... Hmm, I think I'm starting to understand something... Thanks, assistant coaches!",
    "gal-line-4aa8f753-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "We just did what assistant coaches are supposed to do. Now that I think about it, you actually feel quite different on stage compared to off stage, Aria...",
    "gal-line-4aa8f754-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah! You're full of energy on stage, but off stage... You seem a little shy!",
    "gal-line-4aa8f755-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Huh? R—Really...? Maybe it's just that once I'm on stage, everything else slips right out of my mind...",
    "gal-line-4aa8f756-c5c2-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Like this— ♪ Aria's not nervous at all, her heart is filled only with her audience ♪",

    "gal-line-599a6b41-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "And it's—?",
    "gal-line-599a6b42-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Well, since everyone's been practicing pretty hard lately, we've arranged a comment-reading session.",
    "gal-line-599a6b43-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Huh!?",
    "gal-line-599a6b44-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm~ Reading fan comments? I didn't know the assistant coaches had planned such an interesting event~",
    "gal-line-599a9250-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah! I bet everyone has at least some idea of how their fans see them!",
    "gal-line-599a9251-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "However, going through the comments together should help everyone better grasp the team's overall style.",
    "gal-line-599a9252-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "So, ta-da! We've filtered out some specially targeted comments for everyone!",
    "gal-line-599a9253-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Here are the search results. Angels of Delusion members, please read them out loud, word for word.",
    "gal-line-599a9254-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "W—W—Word for word!? Are you sure this isn't some kind of punishment...?",
    "gal-line-599a9255-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Then I'll go first~ \"Nangong is an adorably sweet and cool little devil.\" Wow, even I'm getting a little shy reading something like that~",
    "gal-line-599a9256-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "The terrifying Nangong actually said that in such a calm tone!",
    "gal-line-599a9257-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "D—Do I really have to read this...? *sniff* \"Come to big sis, you adorable crybaby Sunna\"...",
    "gal-line-599a9258-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "W—W—W—What is this!? It's... It's way too embarrassing!",
    "gal-line-599a9259-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Now... it's Aria's turn!",
    "gal-line-599a925a-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "\"I love Aria's singing. Wherever her voice reaches, it feels like sunlight pouring in.\" ...So there are people who see me that way...",
    "gal-line-599a925b-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hm? Why does it feel like the tone of Fairy's selected comments suddenly shifted the moment it got to Aria...",
    "gal-line-599a925c-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Oh really? Let me see... \"Just seeing Aria's smile makes me smile from the heart,\" \"The perfect idol bursting with energy\"...",
    "gal-line-599a925d-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "I have a feeling...",
    "gal-line-599a925e-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Those over-the-top comments suddenly feel... kinda comforting?",
    "gal-line-599a925f-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hehe~ Because Aria really is like a ray of sunshine on stage~",
    "gal-line-599a9260-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Always bursting with energy and spreading joy on stage, you're basically the textbook definition of an \"ideal idol\"!",
    "gal-line-599a9261-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Seeing Aria like that, fans probably feel nothing but warmth and comfort.",
    "gal-line-599a9262-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "...Quite a contrast to someone like me, who can trip just walking onto the stage...",
    "gal-line-599a9263-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm, I think all three of you have your own unique charm. Without any one of you, it just wouldn't be the Angels of Delusion anymore.",
    "gal-line-599a9264-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Exactly! Aria's endless optimism, Sunna's clumsy growth, Nangong's bold mischief... they're all part of what makes up the Angels of Delusion!",
    "gal-line-599a9265-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Mmh...! Thank you, assistant coaches. Reading these comments makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside...",
    "gal-line-599a9266-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Just thinking about how many people love my singing and are touched by my performances... makes me so happy.",
    "gal-line-599a9267-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "So even while offstage, you should trust in that love from your fans, Aria!",
    "gal-line-599a9268-c5da-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Mhm! I'll try my best to be more confident!",

    "gal-line-6b268391-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Should we go over it one more time...?",
    "gal-line-6b268392-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hey, I really got them memorized! Rule number one, absolutely do not reveal that I'm Astra Yao!",
    "gal-line-6b268393-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Second, I need to be careful with my voice when singing — I absolutely can't let anyone know I'm Astra Yao!",
    "gal-line-6b268394-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Third... I can't quite remember. But the point is we absolutely can't let my identity slip! Really now, Belle and Wise. You two are just like Eve this time~",
    "gal-line-6b268395-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Alright, alright, be careful, okay! Wise, start the connection!",

    "gal-line-6b26839e-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Sunna seems to be in some kind of... peculiar state. Miss Fried Rice, do you have any idea what's going on?",
    "gal-line-6b26839f-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hehe~ Leave it to the professionals at times like this! Just give me a moment.",

    "gal-line-6b2683a4-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "♪，♪~~♪♪...(Yes, yes! This way the following track can have room for more variations while the chorus can better stir up emotions, and then we can add some playful little designs in there!)",
    "gal-line-6b2683a5-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "♪–♪! (That's right! Adding little surprises can sometimes lead to unexpected delights!)",

    "gal-line-6b2683ac-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Umm... I'd first like to know what exactly you're up to, my dear sister.",
    "gal-line-6b2683ad-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "I—I just feel like this is the only way I can be part of their conversation...",
    "gal-line-6b2683ae-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Wow, the assistant coach is such a genius~",
    "gal-line-6b2683af-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Yes, yes! That's it! Why didn't I think of that!",
    "gal-line-6b2683b0-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Adding another timbre at this point would make the piece more lively and instantly grab the audience's attention. That's what makes this piece uniquely...",
    "gal-line-6b2683b1-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Huh... Assistant coaches? When did you... Ow! Nangong, why'd you hit my head!",
    "gal-line-6b2683b2-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Great, great, Sunna hasn't gone off the deep end. We've been listening here for ages!",
    "gal-line-6b2683b3-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "I—I—I just happened to... to get a little inspiration, that's all...",
    "gal-line-6b2683b4-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Your tone's back to the usual Sunna again~",
    "gal-line-6b2683b5-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Oh, oh, right! You must be Miss Fried Rice that the assistant coaches mentioned before! Thank you, miss, but can we end today's training here? I want to go back right away... and write down the inspiration I just had!",
    "gal-line-6b2683b6-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Thank you so much! I—I—I've never felt anything like this before! It's like our hearts were connected through music...",
    "gal-line-6b2683b7-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Mhm, I really enjoyed being a training assistant this time too~",
    "gal-line-6b2683b8-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "In that case, you should head back quickly before the inspiration slips away, Sunna.",
    "gal-line-6b2683b9-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Whew... I'm so happy! It's been forever since I've had such a pure musical exchange!",
    "gal-line-6b2683ba-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "I can't believe music can do something like this... Astra and Sunna are both so amazing!",
    "gal-line-6b2683bb-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "It's not that big of a deal~ We're just connected through music...",
    "gal-line-6b2683bc-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hey Nangong, listen! During training just now, I—I—I think I heard Astra's voice...",
    "gal-line-6b2683bd-d1b4-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Don't tell me you've actually gone off the deep end...?",
    "gal-line-6d6238c0-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ah... Someone like me is probably better off staying backstage...",
    "gal-line-6d6238c1-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Sunna, what's wrong?",
    "gal-line-6d625fd0-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Fairy, help us check the training records.",
    "gal-line-6d625fd1-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah, step to the left next... Sunna, wait!",
    "gal-line-6d625fd2-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ahhhh! I can't stop! Get out of the way!",
    "gal-line-6d625fd3-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ouch... Xiao'Yu! Are you okay!?",
    "gal-line-6d625fd4-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "No biggie~ But you should be careful, don't trip!",
    "gal-line-6d625fd5-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "La~ ♪ la la la~~~~ ♪",
    "gal-line-6d625fd6-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "La-laaaa—! *cough cough*! *cough cough cough*!",
    "gal-line-6d625fd7-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Sunna... you okay? Perhaps we should hit a slightly lower harmony...",
    "gal-line-6d625fd8-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "*sobs* It's all my fault... I can't dance well, I can't reach the notes, and I'm just dragging Nangong and Aria down...",
    "gal-line-6d625fd9-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm... this situation... feels like it could use a little encouragement...",
    "gal-line-6d625fda-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "So even someone as amazing as you, Sunna, has worries too, huh.",
    "gal-line-6d625fdb-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Wise, don't say it so flatly! Put a little feeling into it!",
    "gal-line-6d625fdc-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "A—Amazing!? A—Are you talking about me!?",
    "gal-line-6d625fdd-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Of course. It's thanks to the amazing Sunna that Nangong and Aria can truly show their talents.",
    "gal-line-6d625fde-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Right, my fellow assistant coach?",
    "gal-line-6d625fdf-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah, totally! Sunna, you are totally amazing. You can create so many great songs all on your own!",
    "gal-line-6d625fe0-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "I—It's not like I do it all alone... Everyone's been giving me inspiration...",
    "gal-line-6d625fe1-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "But without you, Sunna, a song like this wouldn't exist.",
    "gal-line-6d625fe2-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah! And without a song like this, the Angels of Delusion would be like losing both the angels and the delusion!",
    "gal-line-6d625fe3-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Sunna... you have many other virtues too, yeah?",
    "gal-line-6d625fe4-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Your dance moves are super adorable, and your harmonies are always so creative, and even your clumsy little movements feel lively and full of charm!",
    "gal-line-6d625fe5-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Most importantly, every Angels of Delusion song was written by you — that's something most idols could never do.",
    "gal-line-6d625fe6-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Y—You guys, flattering me like that won't get you anywhere, I'm not that amazing~ Ehe, hehehe~",
    "gal-line-6d625fe7-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Wait... training! Right, we still haven't finished today's training yet!",
    "gal-line-6d625fe8-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Mmm~ mmm~ I'm still waiting for the super~ amazing Sunna to fall into my arms again.",
    "gal-line-6d625fe9-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Wh—What! Nangong, don't say things like that! ...I won't be that careless and crash into you again!",
    "gal-line-6d625fea-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "A—Anyway, let's get back to practicing the new song! Thanks, assistant coaches. We should be able to continue training...",
    "gal-line-6d625feb-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Phew... Sunna's back on her feet again. That's a relief.",
    "gal-line-6d625fec-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Mm. She's always wanted to keep up with the team, so she probably ended up putting too much pressure on herself.",
    "gal-line-6d625fed-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Nice reflexes there, Wise, you deserve some praise!",
    "gal-line-6d625fee-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "I'm used to comforting my short-tempered little sister, so I've gotten pretty good at it... Ouch! You're still so rough...",
    "gal-line-74182e10-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hah... hah... coaches, that song was such a rush! It's been ages since we've practiced a dance to such an uptempo song. So satisfying!",
    "gal-line-74182e11-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yes! Long sessions of singing and dancing are great for training breath control while performing~",
    "gal-line-74182e12-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "F—Finally... it's over. I feel like I'm... about to collapse.",
    "gal-line-74182e13-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "You were already struggling during the warm-up stretches, no?",
    "gal-line-74182e14-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "S—So what! I know you're gonna say something like \"Sunna's totally lame at times like this\" again, aren't you? Hmph!",
    "gal-line-74182e15-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Sunna really nailed it this time~ Even I was impressed!",
    "gal-line-74182e16-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "See? I knew it... Huh? HUH?!",
    "gal-line-74185520-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Did you notice, Sunna? Even with such a challenging \"long and complex piece,\" you kept up from start to finish~",
    "gal-line-74185521-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Y—Yeah, I did! It's like my body moved before my brain could even process what was happening...",
    "gal-line-74185522-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "That's right. Remember that feeling~",
    "gal-line-74185523-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "I was just about to complain that the song Fairy picked seems a bit too difficult...",
    "gal-line-74185524-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Looking at it now, I think it's just at the right level of difficulty.",
    "gal-line-74185525-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Affirmative. Data indicates all members have fully recovered and are ready to begin the next training session.",
    "gal-line-74185526-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Heh heh, bring it on! That was just a warm-up~",
    "gal-line-74185527-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "I'll sing even better this time~!",
    "gal-line-74185528-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "A—Are our assistant coaches some kind of demons...",
    "gal-line-74185529-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm... As much as we'd like to give everyone some specific guidance...",
    "gal-line-7418552a-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "But looking at our dance skills... we've got to admit it's honestly quite a stretch.",
    "gal-line-7418552b-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Master, worry not. Your best AI assistant Fairy has already contacted the perfect candidate to help you.",
    "gal-line-7418552c-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Note: This assistant is an Intelligent Construct with flexibility and rhythm, possessing a lively and cheerful personality.",
    "gal-line-7418552d-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm... those traits sound so familiar... Fairy, don't tell me it's...!",
    "gal-line-7418552e-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Starlight! You guessed it right!",
    "gal-line-7418552f-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Since neither of us is great at dancing, we invited Bil— Starlight as an assistant to guide everyone's dance training~",
    "gal-line-74185530-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hi Mr. Starlight~",
    "gal-line-74185531-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hi, M—Mr. S—Starlight!",
    "gal-line-74185532-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Oh yeah! Don't worry, guys! I'll make you shine on stage — just like starlight!",
    "gal-line-74185533-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "You seem... particularly fired up today.",
    "gal-line-74185534-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Must be because he's being called \"Mr. Starlight\"... Ahem, I'm gonna play the song now~",
    "gal-line-74185535-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Oh? This beat... It's perfect for a training song!",
    "gal-line-74185536-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "...Mr. Starlight, may I ask you a question?",
    "gal-line-74185537-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hm? Of course you can, Aria!",
    "gal-line-74185538-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Are you... an Intelligent Construct?",
    "gal-line-74185539-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm... Did you figure it out from my voice? You're quite the observant one.",
    "gal-line-7418553a-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Huh?! As an Intelligent Construct, how can you be as flexible as a rubber hose?!",
    "gal-line-7418553b-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Heh heh! This is what Mr. Starlight is capable of!",
    "gal-line-7418553c-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Nangong, your power and body control are fantastic! But you might wanna try softening your moves a bit — it'll make the rhythm flow even better.",
    "gal-line-7418553d-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Soften... my moves. I get it now.",
    "gal-line-7418553e-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hey, Sunna, no need to be so tense — it's okay if you mess up a step! Oh yeah, that's it! Just like that, more natural. You're making great progress!",
    "gal-line-7418553f-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "I—I—I'm not nervous at all! Uh wait, is it left foot now... Oh no, do I raise my right hand?!",
    "gal-line-74185540-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "...",
    "gal-line-74185541-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm... Aria, when you dance, don't overthink it — just let your feelings reach the audience!",
    "gal-line-74185542-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "O—Okay!",
    "gal-line-74185543-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah! That's perfect. Now let your dance moves do the talking!",
    "gal-line-74185544-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Alright! That's a wrap on today's dance training. Everyone's made some serious progress!",
    "gal-line-74185545-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "So even gentle movements can pack such power... Thank you, Mr. Starlight!",
    "gal-line-74185546-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Sunna's movements are now much more natural~",
    "gal-line-74185547-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Let me speak for myself! You big meanie Nangong!",
    "gal-line-74185548-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Thank you, Mr. Starlight~ I think I'm starting to understand... how to express emotions through dance steps!",
    "gal-line-74185549-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Uh-huh! This is all thanks to your hard work and training. That's a wrap on this dance training session. See you all later~",
    "gal-line-7418554a-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Thanks for your hard work, Mr.~ Star~light~",
    "gal-line-7418554b-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Manager, please stop calling me that! Ahem, though I gotta admit, being called \"Starlight\" — man, that's awesome, hehe!",
    "gal-line-7418554c-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "But Manager, why do we have to make up names for ourselves?",
    "gal-line-7418554d-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Uh... a Proxy and a Hollow Raider? They aren't exactly identities we can make public. If their fans found out, it could lead to some nasty rumors...",
    "gal-line-7418554e-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yep, and who knows what kind of help Fairy's gonna bring in next... Better safe than sorry.",
    "gal-line-7418554f-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ohhh! You're right! So thoughtful of you, Manager! This is definitely safer!",
    "gal-line-74185550-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Well then, I'm logging off now~ See ya, Manager!",
    "gal-line-74185551-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yep! See ya, Billy!",
    "gal-line-74185552-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Thanks, Billy. See you next time.",
    "gal-line-74185553-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "The Angels of Delusion, they're such good kids with real drive! If the tickets aren't too pricey, I'd love to support their show...",
    "gal-line-74185554-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Huh, a new message... Did the Manager forget to tell me something? This link is...",
    "gal-line-74185555-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "N—Nangong... can you check if my legs are still there? I can barely feel them anymore...",
    "gal-line-74185556-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Owww, that hurts! Why'd you pinch me out of nowhere!?",
    "gal-line-74185557-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hehe, looks like little Sunna's legs are still there~ What a relief!",

    "gal-line-a106a434-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Besides... I'm sure we'll have plenty of chances to meet again in the future. For example, I could buy two tickets to an Angels of Delusion concert...",
    "gal-line-a106a435-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Yeah yeah, you're right Wise! Next time we get the chance, let's go see them live!",
    "gal-line-a106a436-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Nangong, Nangong... what do you think Ms. Cecilia's big surprise will be?",
    "gal-line-a106a437-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "My dear Sunna, that's the twelfth time you've asked~",
    "gal-line-a106a438-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "B—B—But I really want to know... *Sigh* Now that the moment's here, I'm actually getting a bit nervous.",
    "gal-line-a106a439-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "No need to stress, Sunna! My little angels totally crushed it this time!",
    "gal-line-a106a43a-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Rather than calling you the best versions of the Angels of Delusion, I'd say you've shown me a whole new side to the Angels of Delusion~",
    "gal-line-a106a43b-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hehe, looks like our training is paying off, Ms. Cecilia...",
    "gal-line-a106a43c-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Oh right, oh right! The surprise! What's this big surprise you promised, Ms. Cecilia?",
    "gal-line-a106a43d-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "The surprise is... that the Angels of Delusion successfully scored a gig at the 404 Error Live House!",
    "gal-line-a106a43e-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "...",
    "gal-line-a106a43f-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hmm, Sunna's not reacting at all? Oh man, maybe the surprise I prepared was a bit too ordinary...?",
    "gal-line-a106a440-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Ms. Cecilia! Wait a sec! Sunna's passed out!",

    "gal-line-a106a442-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "That's right! Let's show the audience the best Angels of Delusion!",

    "gal-line-a106a445-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "I... also want to share this good news with the assistant coaches.",
    "gal-line-a106a446-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Yeah, I get you. I was even thinking of inviting them over to the show~",
    "gal-line-a106a447-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Though our time together with the assistant coaches online was brief... I've got this feeling we'll definitely meet again someday.",
    "gal-line-a106a448-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Well then, my little angels better give it their all~ Who knows, your assistant coaches might be watching from the audience at your next performance.",
    "gal-line-a106a449-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "You're right, we can't slack off now~",
    "gal-line-a106a44a-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "We gotta show off the best side of the Angels of Delusion at all times.",
    "gal-line-a106a44b-d1b8-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "T—That goes without saying! Of course we'll always be the best Angels of Delusion!",
    "gal-line-c4ed26d0-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Phew, let's call it a day for today's training.",
    "gal-line-c4ed26d1-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "I—I—I wanna practice a bit more. I still can't get the dance steps in the chorus on beat...",
    "gal-line-c4ed26d2-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Me too... The high notes still need some work. Would you all mind going through it with me one more time?",
    "gal-line-c4ed26d3-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm... there's still some parts I wanna practice... Let's just do it once more...",

    "gal-line-c4ed26d5-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "It's Ms. Cecilia!",
    "gal-line-c4ed26d6-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "It's nothing. We just finished training, so everyone's a bit worn out...",
    "gal-line-c4ed26d7-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm, let me give you all a little pep talk~ For all you sweet angels training so hard, I've got a special surprise prepared just for you!",
    "gal-line-c4ed26d8-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "A surprise!? What is it...!",
    "gal-line-c4ed26d9-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Knowing Ms. Cecilia's style, guess it's probably gonna be little hairclips, candy boxes, and other small gifts like that, right?",
    "gal-line-c4ed26da-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Nope~ Hehe, this time I've got a real BIG surprise in store!",
    "gal-line-c4ed26db-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "While I can't tell you just yet, you need to promise me — get ready to welcome this surprise as the best version of the Angels of Delusion you can be!",
    "gal-line-c4ed26dc-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hey, wait, Ms.—  Ah, she hung up...",
    "gal-line-c4ed26dd-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "A—A surprise! I absolutely love surprises! Nangong, Aria, what do you think it would be? Oh, I'm so excited!",
    "gal-line-c4ed26de-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Just waiting for the surprise won't do~ Sunna, don't forget the second part — we gotta welcome it as the best version of the Angels of Delusion!",
    "gal-line-c4ed26df-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "But our recent training... I wouldn't call it our best performance...",
    "gal-line-c4ed26e0-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "*sigh* I guess this is what they call hitting a wall.",
    "gal-line-c4ed26e1-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Is it possible that... if I keep practicing the same way as before, I still won't be able to meet Ms. Cecilia's expectations!?",
    "gal-line-c4ed4de0-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm~ Looks like we'll have to figure this out ourselves and seek some \"special\" help.",
    "gal-line-c4ed4de1-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah! We can't let Ms. Cecilia down!",
    "gal-line-c4ed4de2-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "So... what's this \"special\" help?",
    "gal-line-dbb21770-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "La~♪ La la~~♪",
    "gal-line-dbb21771-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "That was amazing! Everyone get ready. We're starting the next note!",
    "gal-line-dbb21772-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Eh? ♪La— Lala—!♪",
    "gal-line-dbb21773-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Phew... The assistant coaches really love ramping up the difficulty! Thank goodness I managed to hang in there, hehe...",
    "gal-line-dbb21774-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm, looks like our little Sunna's getting good at handling unexpected situations? Ah, Sunna, you're so charming. I'm becoming your fan~",
    "gal-line-dbb21775-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "S—S—Stop talking nonsense! Let's get back to training!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e80-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "La~♪ La...? Eh, it doesn't feel right... How...",
    "gal-line-dbb23e81-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "What's wrong, Aria? Are you feeling sick or...?",
    "gal-line-dbb23e82-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ah, no no, it's just that there was a bit of... signal interference just now?",
    "gal-line-dbb23e83-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ugh... maybe it's time to upgrade my network?",
    "gal-line-dbb23e84-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Huh? Is the connection bad or something...?",
    "gal-line-dbb23e85-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Anyway, let's get back to training first! I'm fine~",
    "gal-line-dbb23e86-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Alright, let's move on to the next note.",
    "gal-line-dbb23e87-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "La—*coughing*!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e88-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "La—♪! Oh no... This note's too high, assistant coaches!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e89-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Looks like the assistant coaches' plan... is to blow the roof off with those high notes~",
    "gal-line-dbb23e8a-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Wise, you raised three keys at once?!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e8b-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "I... I didn't mean to... Let me debug this real quick. Sorry!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e8c-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Junior Belle, I'm still kinda scared...",
    "gal-line-dbb23e8d-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "They say \"a tiger's roar makes all beasts tremble in the forest\"... If I teach these idols, I just hope they don't scare all their fans away...",
    "gal-line-dbb23e8e-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "We're not going to teach them the tiger's roar, Senior Sister! It's about \"Qi\" — we're asking you to come down the mountain to teach them how to properly utilize their breathing!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e8f-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ahem, well... if they could learn even half of your aura, wouldn't they have better control of the stage?",
    "gal-line-dbb23e90-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hehe, you just hit the nail on the head! Junior Wise is right... I'm ready!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e91-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Alright, let's get connected~",
    "gal-line-dbb23e92-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hey, assistant coaches~ You're finally here! Today's training is something about... the \"art of breathing\"?",
    "gal-line-dbb23e93-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "That's right! I am none other than the Master Tiger, invited here to teach you all the \"art of breathing\"!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e94-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ms. Tiger's voice... sounds kinda cute...?",
    "gal-line-dbb23e95-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "It's Master Tiger! Master, this is just a little greeting joke... Master?",
    "gal-line-dbb23e96-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Wait... j—j—j—junior! One of our little friends here isn't breathing! Quick! We gotta save her!!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e97-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Huh? No one's... Wait, Aria! Aria, breathe!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e98-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Huh? Ah! Sorry! I'm breathing...! Exhale... inhale...",
    "gal-line-dbb23e99-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "S—S—She's just warming up! Yeah, that's right. She's just holding her breath to get warmed up for training!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e9a-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Phew, that's a relief... Looks like you've mastered the art of playing dead, my friend... You even had me fooled for a second!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e9b-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ahem! Now that the misunderstanding has been cleared up, let's officially begin the training.",
    "gal-line-dbb23e9c-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Alright, training track... Let's pick this one. And... play!",
    "gal-line-dbb23e9d-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ha... ha... ha...",
    "gal-line-dbb23e9e-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm... Sunna, your breathing is a bit shallow. Watch how I do it — breathe deep and feel your diaphragm expanding, nice and steady...",
    "gal-line-dbb23e9f-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm... focusing my breath using my diaphragm, a bit deeper... Wow, it really works! Singing doesn't feel as tiring anymore!",
    "gal-line-dbb23ea0-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Nangong, your breathing seems a bit rushed... Control your breathing more during big movements – in slowly, and out slowly...",
    "gal-line-dbb23ea1-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Control my breathing with the rhythm of the movements... *exhale*... Wow, it's actually working!",
    "gal-line-dbb23ea2-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm... Mmhmm...",
    "gal-line-dbb23ea3-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Master Tiger...? What about Aria?",
    "gal-line-dbb23ea4-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Junior Sister, it's my fault for not being skilled enough! I've got nothing to teach Aria! She's a master!",
    "gal-line-dbb23ea5-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Such rock-solid presence... I've only ever felt it from Yixuan Shifu and Banyue Shifu!",
    "gal-line-dbb23ea6-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Um, so... what do I need to do?",
    "gal-line-dbb23ea7-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Master Aria, you've already graduated from this training...",
    "gal-line-dbb23ea8-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Huh???",
    "gal-line-dbb23ea9-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Wow... impressive, Aria!",
    "gal-line-dbb23eaa-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "A—As expected of Aria...",
    "gal-line-dbb23eab-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "My dear juniors, mission accomplished! Nangong and Sunna, you're both such bright and determined kids!",
    "gal-line-dbb23eac-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Thanks for your hard work, Senior Sister!",
    "gal-line-dbb23ead-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Though, I suggest you tweak their training schedule a bit.",
    "gal-line-dbb23eae-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Why do you say that, Senior Sister?",
    "gal-line-dbb23eaf-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "I looked over the training schedule and noticed some of the sessions are pretty intense, even for a mystic...",
    "gal-line-dbb23eb0-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "The difficulty's THAT high?!",
    "gal-line-dbb23eb1-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Mm, thanks, Senior. We'll think about it carefully.",
    "gal-line-dbb23eb2-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Alright, I'm logging off now~ Oh, and don't forget to come by the temple for a meal whenever you can... Without you guys around, Junior Yinhu's char siu buns are starting to turn back into plain steamed buns!",
    "gal-line-dbb23eb3-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Belle, what do you think?",
    "gal-line-dbb23eb4-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Maybe... we should tweak the training system a bit. I do think the recent training's been a little too intense...",
    "gal-line-dbb23eb5-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm, although Fairy will control the training intensity... it's still best not to let them practice to the point of exhaustion...",
    "gal-line-dbb23eb6-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Yeah, too much of anything is bad! Overtraining will only hurt your body!",
    "gal-line-dbb23eb7-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Like Master Tiger said, channel your energy to your diaphragm, and breathe in and out slowly...",
    "gal-line-dbb23eb8-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ugh... I lost control of my breathing again. This is so hard. Master Aria, please teach me~",
    "gal-line-dbb23eb9-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "D—Don't make fun of me! I'm not even sure how this whole \"breathing\" thing works...",
    "gal-line-dbb23eba-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "*sigh* But it is really hard~",
    "gal-line-dbb23ebb-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Or... maybe we could hit up the assistant coaches and see if they've got any tips?",
    "gal-line-dbb23ebc-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Huh? Whaaaat? I can't seem to connect to the network here. Did the signal drop out?",
    "gal-line-dbb23ebd-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ah! Let me check if my internet bill is due now...",
    "gal-line-dbb23ebe-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Aria, please~ Could you connect to a public Wi-Fi first, and then help me turn on your hotspot?",
    "gal-line-dbb23ebf-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Geez, I'm not a walking hotspot... Hurry up!",
    "gal-line-dbb23ec0-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Alright, alright, alright~ Aria, you're the best. On it! Now... successfully connected to Aria!",
    "gal-line-dbb23ec1-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm... Since I'm already connected, do I still need to upgrade the network?",
    "gal-line-dbb23ec2-c5f0-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm~ Can't say for sure if it's a network issue yet. Let me check it out real quick.",
    "gal-line-e200d0d0-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Huff... huff... *Takes a sip of water* S—Superstar Sunna, making her entrance~",
    "gal-line-e200d0d1-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hehe... I actually scored a premium VIP ticket with exclusive merch! This is awesome...",
    "gal-line-e200d0d2-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "What premium... Wait, how did I fall asleep...? Aria, wake up, let go of my leg, you're hugging too tight and my foot's gone numb—",
    "gal-line-e200d0d3-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Huh...? Ahhh sorry Nangong, I'll let go right away...",
    "gal-line-e200d0d4-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Don't worry about it. More importantly, looks like we all dozed off... We haven't even properly finished today's training yet...",
    "gal-line-e200d0d5-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "A—About training, there's a message from the assistant coaches: \"To my little angels, we're taking a break today, take some time to unwind!\"",
    "gal-line-e200d0d6-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Wow! The assistant coaches are such angels~",
    "gal-line-e200d0d7-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hey Aria, have you been feeling like... you're lagging lately?",
    "gal-line-e200d0d8-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Huh? Nope, I'm in top form lately!",
    "gal-line-e200d0d9-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "That's good. Hmm... Now, there's just one last thing to do... I'll tap—",
    "gal-line-e200d0da-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "...Huh? Strange, just now for a moment...",
    "gal-line-e200d0db-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "I disconnected from the hotspot! Been meaning to do that for ages, hehe~",
    "gal-line-e200d0dc-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "F—Folks in the back, l—lemme see your hands, hehe...",
    "gal-line-e200d0dd-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Alright, will do, Miss \"Superstar\" Sunna~",
    "gal-line-e200d0de-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Uwahhhhh! What's going on... N—Nangong?!",
    "gal-line-e200d0df-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Here are the hands you wanted to see, enjoy~",
    "gal-line-e200d0e0-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Okay, okay... I'm awake now! Stop squishing my face... Waaauuugh...",
    "gal-line-e200d0e1-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Wise, are our adjustments to the training system really working? Everyone seems to be under even more pressure now...",
    "gal-line-e200d0e2-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hmm, I'm a bit skeptical too, since everyone fell asleep from exhaustion during our last online session...",
    "gal-line-e200d0e3-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Could it be... that Fairy rearranged the schedule again? Fairy! Huh, seems like Fairy's not around...",
    "gal-line-e200d0e4-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Let's start today's training then. We can ask her about it after we're done.",
    "gal-line-e200d0e5-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hmm– Today's training course is perfect for the current Angels of Delusion! The assistant should be...",
    "gal-line-e200d0e6-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Well, well, well~ These young'uns nowadays, all of 'em with their fancy ideas. Looks like they need some guidance from lil' ol' me who's been 'round the block.",
    "gal-line-e200d0e7-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "*Gulp* *gulp* Hah... Yeah, Sunna's little schemes have been getting more frequent lately... Here, pour me another! *Gulp*...",
    "gal-line-e200d0e8-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Oh~ That's quite a way to down it, young'un. What flavor of Nitro-Fuel ya got there?",
    "gal-line-e200d0e9-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Of course it's 100% freshly squeezed juice!",
    "gal-line-e200d0ea-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "HAHAHAHAHA! Wow, I had no idea backstage could be this much fun!",
    "gal-line-e200d0eb-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Is... Is this fun...? Ugh, well, at least it's better than being up on stage...",
    "gal-line-e200d0ec-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "I still prefer writing songs backstage... Sure, performing has its happy moments, but getting up there is still too much for me!",
    "gal-line-e200d0ed-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "I still remember my first time on stage... I messed up the very first move, boo hoo...",
    "gal-line-e200d0ee-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Wow, that's super amazing! So you're saying you were the center of attention from your very first step on stage!?",
    "gal-line-e200d0ef-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "W-W-What— I—I don't want to be the center of attention!!!",
    "gal-line-e200d0f0-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Wise, um... did I do something wrong when I launched the connection?",
    "gal-line-e200d0f1-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Heh, I think this is quite nice, and everyone could use a chance to unwind right now. Hey, have you seen Aria?",
    "gal-line-e200d0f2-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "...",
    "gal-line-e200d0f3-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hmm... Aria seems pretty out of her element in this kind of atmosphere...",
    "gal-line-e200d0f4-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Ah, assistant coaches, you're here.",
    "gal-line-e200d0f5-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Assistant coaches! W—We haven't been slacking off, I'm ready for training!",
    "gal-line-e200d0f6-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hey assistant coaches~ What's on the training schedule today?",
    "gal-line-e200d0f7-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Oh come on Sunna, don't be so tense! Today's training is... to kick back and chill! Hehe, everyone can just take it easy and recharge~",
    "gal-line-e200d0f8-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "HHuh, for real? No training today? Long live the assistant coaches!!",
    "gal-line-e200d0f9-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Oh ho? So Sunna doesn't want to train with us that badly, huh? That's kinda heartbreaking...",
    "gal-line-e200d0fa-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "No, no, no! That's not it! I'm actually really happy to be training with you two...",
    "gal-line-e200d0fb-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Alright, alright, Nangong, stop picking on Sunna at a time like this.",
    "gal-line-e200d0fc-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Oh, right! At a happy moment like this, we should... throw an online Nitro-Fuel party!",
    "gal-line-e200d0fd-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Wait wait wait, no you can't!!",
    "gal-line-e200d0fe-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "As expected of Burnice and Piper... They really know how to, uhhh... live life to the fullest...",
    "gal-line-e200d0ff-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Yeah! The assistants Fairy found and the training schedule she arranged are just perfect. Nice work, Fairy!",
    "gal-line-e200d100-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Fairy? Hmm... Strange, there's still no response even after Belle praised her...",
    "gal-line-e200d101-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hold up, Wise... Something's off. There are some extra signal transmission logs on the HDD...",
    "gal-line-e200d102-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "F—F—Finally! It's finally over!",
    "gal-line-e200d103-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Yeah, today's the last training session. Wonder what the final test will be like... I'm so nervous.",
    "gal-line-e200d104-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "...About the final test, there's something I need to say, and it's about Aria.",
    "gal-line-e200d105-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Huh? Me?",
    "gal-line-e200d106-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hmm. Let's look back. Aria, why did you experience those random moments of lag during training?",
    "gal-line-e200d107-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "And why does our training difficulty subtly change every time Aria lags?",
    "gal-line-e200d108-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "And here's something weirder: after I connected with Aria, those random lags just stopped...",
    "gal-line-e200f7e0-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "According to my investigation, there's only one truth. Aria, you are the core of the entire training system!",
    "gal-line-e200f7e1-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Huh?!",
    "gal-line-e200f7e2-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Aria is... the core of the entire training system?!",
    "gal-line-e200f7e3-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "I'm just as surprised... For some reason, the training system seems to be built on Aria's local processor.",
    "gal-line-e200f7e4-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Any adjustments made in the system will be directly transmitted to Aria...",
    "gal-line-e200f7e5-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "The changes to the training system will cause Aria's perception to slightly desync from reality, leading to weird reactions during training... Such as spacing out and lagging...",
    "gal-line-e200f7e6-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "I see, so that's how it is... The desync causes the lag. When Nangong connected to me, it cut off my local processing directly, which is why things went back to normal...",
    "gal-line-e200f7e7-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "B—But... shouldn't system adjustments be part of the training plan?",
    "gal-line-e200f7e8-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hmm, seems like there's some mysterious figure behind the scenes, constantly tweaking the training schedule...",
    "gal-line-e200f7e9-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "But here's the thing — seems like someone made some unplanned adjustments. What do you think, Sunna?",
    "gal-line-e200f7ea-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "W—W—What—",
    "gal-line-e200f7eb-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Your eyes are darting away... But you're not the only one. According to my research, Ms. Cecilia and the assistant coaches have all been tweaking the training system too.",
    "gal-line-e200f7ec-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "So you're saying... all these unplanned adjustments piled up and made the current system... a little wonky?",
    "gal-line-e200f7ed-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Hmm, if this keeps up... I'm afraid we'll be facing a veeeery terrifying final test~",
    "gal-line-e200f7ee-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "W—W—What should I do?! I didn't mean to...",
    "gal-line-e200f7ef-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "But don't worry, the omniscient and great Nangong has already figured out a solution~",
    "gal-line-e200f7f0-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "During my previous investigation, by connecting with Aria, I've located the system port. I just need to hit reset and everything will be back to normal!",
    "gal-line-e200f7f1-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "O—Oh, I get it now! As expected of Nangong!",
    "gal-line-e200f7f2-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Humhum, I wouldn't mind a bit more praise~ Now then, here we go, one-click reset! I'm pressing—",
    "gal-line-e200f7f3-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "No! Wait, Nangong, don't press it!",
    "gal-line-e200f7f4-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Input confirmed. Due to a fatal system error, the system will crash in 10 seconds. 10...9...",
    "gal-line-e200f7f5-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Uh oh... looks like I messed up...",
    "gal-line-e200f7f6-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "D—D—Do something, quick!!",
    "gal-line-e200f7f7-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Rest assured. Your excellent and reliable AI assistant will always show up at crucial moments like these.",
    "gal-line-e200f7f8-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Fair... my AI assistant, where have you been all this time!",
    "gal-line-e200f7f9-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "If I'm not mistaken, this... reliable AI assistant must be the one adjusting our training program behind the scenes.",
    "gal-line-e200f7fa-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Not only that... she's also handling our \"unplanned\" adjustments, so she can resolve the current situation instantly, right?",
    "gal-line-e200f7fb-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Affirmative. You finally understand my efforts behind the scenes. I propose increasing the monthly electricity threshold to 200% of the current value.",
    "gal-line-e200f7fc-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Alright, alright, good job~ At least the problem's solved in the end.",
    "gal-line-e200f7fd-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Note: While the system has been saved from crashing, the changes made are irreversible...",
    "gal-line-e200f7fe-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "The changes are irreversible... wait, that means!",
    "gal-line-e200f7ff-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Final test, input complete...",
    "gal-line-e200f800-d1b7-11f0-a010-3d878ea0a3f9": "Affirmative. What you're about to face is a completely unplanned final test.",
    "gal-line-eeeb9430-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "A few days ago, on the first morning of training...",
    "gal-line-eeeb9431-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Fairy!! What's up with this \"Professional Idol Assistant Coach\" commission?!",
    "gal-line-eeeb9432-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "So the training target is the Angels of Delusion...?",
    "gal-line-eeeb9433-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "No no no, the real issue here is that we don't have any experience training idols at all, Wise!",
    "gal-line-eeeb9434-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Don't worry, Master. New Eridu's most capable AI assistant has already designed and arranged the training schedule for you.",
    "gal-line-eeeb9435-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Additionally, I have screened and contacted suitable assistants to meet the requirement of providing \"professional training\" to the client.",
    "gal-line-eeeb9436-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "You even contacted others... Fairy, you're moving way too fast!",
    "gal-line-eeeb9437-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "I presume you might need this additional information: The commission fee for this task is ███ Dennies.",
    "gal-line-eeeb9438-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "That much?!",
    "gal-line-eeeb9439-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ahem, Fairy, we'll let it slide this time. But if there's a next time, I hope you'll discuss it with us first.",
    "gal-line-eeeb943a-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Affirmative. The request has been added to my to-do list with priority level \"do as I deem fit.\"",
    "gal-line-eeeb943b-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Suggestion: For this commission, I recommend that you take on the role of \"Mystery Assistant Coach.\"",
    "gal-line-eeeb943c-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Huh? We can't reveal our identities? This feels like I'm on some secret mission...",
    "gal-line-eeeb943d-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "If Fairy suggests this, there must be a reason. At this point, let's just trust her.",
    "gal-line-eeeb943e-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Thank you for your understanding. Your best AI assistant will immediately draft your upcoming training schedule.",
    "gal-line-eeeb943f-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Don't you think Fairy's been acting kinda weird... First taking on this commission by herself, and then actively reaching out to helpers...",
    "gal-line-eeeb9440-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "I have the same feeling... but if she has something in mind, we'll surely find out gradually during this process.",
    "gal-line-eeeb9441-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Well, that's true but... Ah whatever, forget about it! Let's get familiar with the upcoming schedule instead. What's the training plan for day one?",
    "gal-line-eeeb9442-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Uh... stacking blocks?",
    "gal-line-eeeb9443-c5ee-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Huh??",
    "gal-line-f717d2a0-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm~ Special training? I didn't expect the assistant coaches to think I needed some one-on-one practice too~",
    "gal-line-f717d2a1-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "That's just what we call it! All three of you will have to go through it. This way we can better observe each member's unique traits...",
    "gal-line-f717d2a2-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm~ This little bit of dance practice? Easy peasy~",
    "gal-line-f717d2a3-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Wow! Such strong rhythm, and every move hits exactly right...",
    "gal-line-f717d2a4-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "So... next up is vocal training.",
    "gal-line-f717d2a5-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "♪ La la la la la la la ♪",
    "gal-line-f717d2a6-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm, your breath control is steady, and both the high notes and the runs came out perfectly...",
    "gal-line-f717d2a7-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "All done with today's training? Then I'll log off for now~",
    "gal-line-f717d2a8-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Ah, alright. Good work today, Nangong.",
    "gal-line-f717d2a9-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Wise! Nangong is incredible...",
    "gal-line-f717d2aa-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "As expected of a genius from the Angels of Delusion.",
    "gal-line-f717d2ab-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Note: Observation indicates that Nangong Yu is still in training mode.",
    "gal-line-f717d2ac-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Huh? But today's training schedule is already finished.",
    "gal-line-f717d2ad-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Belle, shall we open a remote link to the practice room?",
    "gal-line-f717d2ae-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Hmm, Aria's overall performance looks good, but this part of the choreography feels a bit stiff. Let's keep that in mind for the next routine.",
    "gal-line-f717d2af-c5ed-11f0-af61-9184941efb97": "Sunna... I should give her some extra practice to reinforce the basics, though she's already working really hard.",
